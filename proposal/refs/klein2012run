This paper introduces a tool called Redex used for creating mechanized semantic models of programming languages. This tool helps to create executable models of programming languages, state and prove theorems, run randomized testing to detect bugs in the language etc. This work is important to this proposal because redex is going to used in this research to create semantic models of task parallel programming languages.
