Creating model checking tools for the new parallel programming languages being developed is very complex and requires great deal of effort. Instead, modifying an existing model checker to suit the needs of the new languages is easier and it helps to use all the advanced features that the existing model checker has for testing the new language. This paper describes the efforts needed to modify an existing model checker JPF to verify programs written in the X10 language.
