This paper introdces a framework to create interleaving free models of isolated hierarchical parallel computations. Since, this framework applies to task parallel programming languages, it can be used to model Habanero Java language. This paper also discusses the complexity of deciding state-reachability for finite-data recursive programs. Using this algorithm, we can say that the computing the state reachability for Habanero Java programs is EXPSAPCE-hard.
