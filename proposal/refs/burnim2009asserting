This paper proposes an assertion framework that can be used to specify pairs of program state that can arise due to non-deterministic thread inter-leavings. Such pairs of program state result in a deterministic result in spite of the different parallel schedules. This work is important to this proposal because it specifies method to find out deterministic behavior in parallel programs.
