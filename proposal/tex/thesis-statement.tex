\section{Thesis Statement}
The slice and dice algorithm, in the context of the JPF model checker,
will explore fewer states on average before error discovery than other
state of the art algorithms to mitigate state explosion in scheduling
non-determinism including POR, heuristic guided search, and K-bounded
delay, over a set of commonly accepted benchmark programs.
