\section{Thesis Statement}
A computation graph is a suitable common representation of the execution of any task parallel program, and the computation graph is sufficient to determine all relevant schedules over tasks that need to be explored to enumerate all the possible behaviors of the program and such an exhaustive enumeration is enough for detecting non-determinism of output.
