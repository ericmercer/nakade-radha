\section{Thesis Statement}
A computation graph is a suitable common representation of the execution of any task parallel program. The computation graph is sufficient to determine all relevant schedules over tasks that need to be explored to enumerate all the possible behaviors of the program. Such an exhaustive enumeration is enough for verifying deterministic behavior in task parallel programs.
