\section{Thesis Statement}
A computation graph is a suitable common representation for any task parallel program, and the computation graph is sufficient to determine all relevant schedules over tasks that need to be explored to enumerate all the possible behaviors of the program. Such an exhaustive enumeration is sufficient for general verification.
