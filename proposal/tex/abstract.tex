A computation graph of a task parallel program is a directed acyclic graph that represents the execution of the program. A computation graph can be used to locate data-races in parallel programs. It can also be used to identify meaningful thread schedules in programs with data-races to determine the determinacy of output in such programs. This proposal outlines the implementation details of the computation graph builder and analyzer for task parallel programs using Java Path Finder. It also gives a list of benchmarks that will used to validate the correctness of this approach.
